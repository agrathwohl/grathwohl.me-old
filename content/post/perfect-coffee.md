## Today, I quite accidentally brewed my best cup of coffee - by far.

The moment today's morning coffee brew touched my lips, I knew that I had struck gold. The flavor was so intense - the caffeine potency so strong - that it would be a travesty to not share today's coffee-brewing methodology with the world.

Unfortunately, this moment of excellence could not have happened to a worse person. I know nothing about the ~~science~~ art of coffee brewing, so I cannot impart any actual knowledge about what I did to generate the ideal cup of coffee.

Nonetheless, I was lucky to have captured this morning's entire routine on video, thanks to my newly-installed Ubiquiti IP dome camera. So, what I can do is make a coffee-brewing "run book" of sorts - but not without introducing my readers to my relatively au naturel lifestyle. Such is the price, I guess, of starring in my own sort of closed-circuit reality TV series.

After studying the blocky H.264 play-by-play of today's relatively bizarre undertaking, I wrote up a time-accurate howto.  So, if you want to achieve the stunning results that I did today, just follow the below procedure. If you wish to achieve results comparable to mine, you'll likely want to follow my instructions as closely as possible.
